# Flagparse

[![Build Status][BuildStatus]](https://travis-ci.org/ybubnov/flagparse)


Flagparse is a simple implementation of modern command-line interfaces with
nested commands. This library removes the pain of manually constructing the
argument parsing and applying handler for each command, all of this is done
by this tiny library.

## Installation

```sh
pip install flagparse
```

## Usage and documentation

Please see the [wiki][Wiki] for basic usage and other documentation of using
flagparse.
